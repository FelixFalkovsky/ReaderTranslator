# ReaderTranslator with SwiftUI, Combine and Catalyst for MacOS, iPad and iPhone

While I am waiting the commercial SwiftUI projects I decided to dedicate my free time to build this open-source project.

Base idea:
Since I read a lot of books or articles in a foreign language I periodically turn to Google Translate 
to understand unfamiliar idioms, words or to find a sutable expressions or words in my native language.
And I like to listen to how a word or sentence is pronounced through the voice engine of the system or Google Translate(or others services).
Although this process is simple I would like to make it as more comfortable as possible.
Sometimes I am lazy to look into the translator and I make an assumption about the meaning of a word or idiom and it can lead to a missunderstanding which turns into even greater loss of my time.

Description:
Read PDFs and Web pages with Google Translate embedded.

This project is demo how to use SwiftUI, Combine and Catalyst together
